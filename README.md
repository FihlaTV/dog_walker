+ Utilized CarrierWave for image upload and processing
+ Used the Twilio API to allow users to send text messages to other users
+ Developed complex database model with user-restricted layers of information access

## Usage

## Development/Contribution

Wanna write some tests? Wanna chart some poops?

## Future

- Full test coverage
- Better server integration
- Allow owners to make appointments through the application
- Allow walkers to see their schedule past the current day
- Allow poop chart to include info about whether the pet was fed, or peed, and info on all past poops (rather than just the past 7 days)
